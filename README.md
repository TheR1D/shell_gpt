# ShellGPT integrations
Shell integration allows you to use Shell-GPT in your terminal with hotkeys. It is currently available for bash and zsh. It will allow you to have `sgpt` completions in your shell history, and also edit suggested commands right away.

# Installation
```shell
# TODO
```

# Usage
In your terminal enter natural language command, and press `Ctrl+l` to get suggestions. It will replace your current input line (buffer) with the suggested command.
```text
List all txt files in current folder (Ctrl+l)
# -> ls *.txt
```
